<p> My name is Baylee and I am a student pursuing a degree in Psychology with a minor in Technical and Professonial Writing</p>
<p>I work as a nanny full time and take all online classes this semester which is, to say the least, nerve racking. I have three siblings, all younger than me. The one closest in age to me is my almost 20-year-old sister, Callie, and everyone thinks we are twins...Everyone. My family is wonderful!</p>
<p>I am working on a life plan for when I graduate soon. I know I want to live in San Antonio but I'm not sure if I want to do my masters here or somewhere in San Antonio. Still figuring out life. Can't wait!</p></body>
